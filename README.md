# Image Classification Using CNN for Glasses Detection

This project aims to differentiate between people with and without eyeglasses using facial analysis. The primary goal is to build a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying images based on the presence of glasses.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Collection**: Images of people with and without glasses.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Image augmentation and resizing.
- **Model Building**: Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.

## Description

This project utilizes a deep learning approach to classify images of individuals based on whether they are wearing glasses. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. The dataset consists of images of people with and without glasses, and various techniques such as data augmentation and normalization are applied to improve the model's performance.

### Key Features:

- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming are used to increase the diversity of the training data.
- **CNN Architecture**: The model is built using a series of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's accuracy and loss are monitored, and confusion matrices are used to assess its performance.
